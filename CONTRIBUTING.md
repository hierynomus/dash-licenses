## Build

The project uses standard Maven to build. 

The project uses Java 11 language features. **Java 11 or greater is required.**

From the root:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

The build generates:

- a shaded JAR, `./core/target/org.eclipse.dash.licenses-<version>.jar` that contains 
everything that is required to run from the command line; and
- a Maven plugin, `org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check`.
